<span style="background-color: white><p>Few bands have had such a huge effect on musical culture, as The Jesus and Mary Chain. <p> Their attitude alone, dressed in black, angry with the world, playing short sets drenched in feedback, set the bench mark in the post Sex Pistols music scene of London.<p> Their seminal debut album Psychocandy would go on to change the course of popular music, channeling the sneering angst and noise distortion of the live shows into hypnotic sweet melodies layered with dark lyrics that would beguile and bewilder. Released into the world, The Jesus and Mary Chain became the darlings of British press, as they searched to find the owner of the post punk crown in the mid 80’s. With strong Velvet Underground influences, and a despondent but melodic wall of noise, they went on to become the inspiration for such critically acclaimed bands such as My Bloody Valentine in the early 90’s.<p>

The band formed in East Kilbride, a wasteland on the outskirts of Glasgow, Scotland in 1983, around the writing partnership of the Reid brothers, William and Jim.<p>
They soon moved to London and their “win or die trying” attitude and thrashing guitar sound, was bought to the attention of Alan Mcgee and Creation records, by Bobby Gillespie, vocalist with another Scottish band, Primal Scream. The first single “Upside Down” was released, and Gillespie joined the band as drummer. Gillespie pursued the Velvet Underground, single snare and floor tom sound that became prevalent on the recording of the Psychocandy album.<p>

In stark contrast to the adrenaline fueled 15 minute live shows, that often ended in violence and riot, (as the Reid’s inflammatory interaction with the thrill hungry crowd, saw them provoking utter chaos,) the slow throbbing noise pop Psychcocandy album, spawned such classics as “Just Like Honey” and “Some Candy Talking.”
